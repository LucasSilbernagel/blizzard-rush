### Returns

Please follow this link to our return policy: [Return Policy](/easy-returns)

### Warranty claims

Blizzard Rush offers no direct warranty on the items it sells. The various warranties are carried out by the manufacturers and they decide if a product is covered and how. These warranties generally cover manufacturing defects and not breakage or normal wear and tear. Empire acts as a 3rd party between the customers and the manufacturers to help streamline the warranty process when possible.

To make a warranty claim, the item must have been purchased at Blizzard Rush less than 1 year from the date you are making the claim. Past that delay, you must contact the manufacturer directly.

Most manufacturers that offer a limited warranty will not cover an item if:

- The item has been assembled or used improperly (misuse and abuse)
- The damage to the item is not resulting from a manufacturing defect
- The damage to the item is the result of normal wear and tear
- The damage to the item is deliberate
- The damage is caused by modifications or alterations to the item

To help speed up the process, make sure to contact us with as many pictures as possible of the item and its damage as well as your original order number or proof of purchase. We will then send all that information to our warranty department who will get back to us with a first appraisal. We will then let you know what the next steps are.

Do not discard any item for which you want to make a warranty claim. If an item is deemed eligible for warranty, you will be asked to send it back to us so we can inspect the damage and coordinate with the manufacturer. Return shipping fees for warranty items are to be paid by the customer. If you wish for the manufacturer to cover the return shipping costs, you must contact them directly and process the warranty claim through them.

### Pricing & price matching:

Prices are always subject to change without notice. ALL Prices listed on the Blizzard Rush online store are not applicable in any of our retail stores and vice versa. The online store faces a different competition than our retail locations, therefore prices may vary.

If you provide us with screenshots and links to another Canadian supplier that has the same item, in the same color, size and collection, we will be able to match the price. Our price matches are only valid for unused products and are calculated in Canadian dollars. Please note that the competitor’s shipping fee will be factored into the price match calculation. We will only offer price matching for the price the item is sold for by the competitor at the moment of the request.

We reserve the right to refuse a price match on certain items.

### Original hang tags & bulk orders:

Items sold on our website are not meant for resale. Some of them are displayed in our storefronts, which means that they may have been handled by customers, some brand hang tags may be removed and the original wrapping may be removed. We do not allow bulk orders and will not be supplying original wrapping or hang tags when they are missing. Please inquire as to what the status of an item is before ordering it. All the products we have in store are original, unused products. You can verify our status as licensed dealers on the websites of all the brands we carry.

## Order cancellation:

All order cancellation requests must be made within 12 business hours of placing the order. All cancellation requests made after that delay are subject to a 4.99$ + tx cancellation fee. That fee is put in place to cover the cost of shipping and handling incurred when an order is already being processed when it’s cancelled.

## FAQ

### Do you offer price matching?

If you provide us with screenshots and links to another Canadian supplier that has the same item, in the same color, size and collection, we will be able to match the price. Our price matches are only valid for unused products and are calculated in Canadian dollars. Please note that the competitor’s shipping fee will be factored into the price match calculation.

### Can I modify an order that has already been confirmed?

Once an order has been placed and confirmed, we cannot modify the items (size, quantity, add or remove). We also cannot modify a shipping address or shipping options.

If you wish to make those changes, we must cancel the order and you must place a new one.

### Can I cancel my order?

If your order has been placed and confirmed but not yet billed and shipped, we can intercept and cancel it. Once it has been billed and shipped, we can no longer cancel the order. All orders cancelled after 12 business hours being placed are subject to a 4.99$ cancellation fee.

### There’s an item missing in my order or my order is incorrect, how should I proceed?

If there’s an item missing from your order, make sure to check your packing slip to see if the item is listed. If the item is missing and is not listed on the packing list, it’s possible that the item was out of stock and has not been charged on your final order.

If an item is listed on your packing list but isn’t included in your order, please take pictures of the package as you received it as well as its content and the packing slip.

### I’m getting a zip/postal code error message when trying to complete my transaction, what do I do?

This error message appears because the postal code you’re using for your billing address doesn’t match the postal code registered with your credit card company. You can correct this by contacting your credit supplier and updating your postal code or by using Paypal Express checkout, which will allow you to use the same credit card but will securize the transaction.

### I don’t see Sezzle as a payment option, how can I use it to pay for my order?

Sezzle is only eligible for snowboard and splitboard equipment that is not highly discounted. However, if you add an eligible item to your order, your whole order will become eligible for Sezzle.

### I’d like to have precisions regarding the sizings displayed on your website (W09 vs 09, K02 vs T02)

Here are some precisions regarding the shoe sizings displayed on our website:

- Sizes preceded by a W are women’s sizing. This means that a size displayed as W09 is a women’s size 9. There are some models made for both men and women, in which case both sizings will be displayed one after the other. This means that the Unisex(Men) sizing will be displayed first, followed by the women’s sizing.
  (Ex: 07.5/W09, this sizing would designate a size 7.5 for men and a size 9 for women.

- Sizings preceded by a K will designate Kids’ sizings. (Ex: K03 will be a size 3 for kids) Sizings preceded by a T will designate Toddlers’ sizings. Sizings preceded by a B will be Baby sizings.

- If you’re unsure about a sizing feel free to reach out to us or consult the manufacturer’s size chart to see all the specifications for the model you want.
