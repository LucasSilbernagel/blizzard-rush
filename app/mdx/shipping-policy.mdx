# We ship from Canada

Avoid annoying customs fees and complicated returns by ordering from inside Canada. Save time, money and support a Canadian business.

Sales tax is determined according to the shipping address. If your billing address is in Qu√©bec but your shipping address is in Ontario, Ontario sales tax will be charged. We do not charge sales tax for International Orders.

## International orders

- Empire offers international shipping with Canada Post to a number of international countries.
- All additional tax, duties or custom charges are to be covered by the client.
- We strongly suggest placing any international orders using Paypal as your method of payment.
- Due to agreements with certain companies, some products on the site are strictly reserved to our Canadian customers and therefore can only be shipped to a Canadian address.
