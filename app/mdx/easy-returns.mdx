# 30 day easy returns

## Return window

You have 30 days following the shipping date of your order to return any unused items.
Items that were on sale are eligible for return as long as they are NOT marked as FINAL SALE.

## Easy return

Fill in your return request in our portal:

1. To begin a return request, simply log into your account to start the process. You will need to input your order number (without the # sign) and postal code to get the process started. If you need assistance during the return process, please contact us.

2. Print your return label supplied by the portal.

3. Re-package your items:

   - The majority of our orders are shipped in resealable bags or cardboard boxes. Both can be reused to ship back any returns if they are still in fair condition.
   - Send back your items with ALL of their original tags. Any removal of the manufacturer’s sewn-in tags will automatically result in the denial of your return.
   - Send back items in their original packaging.
   - Make sure the items are unwashed, unused and in their original new state.

4. Securely pack your return with the provided packing slip inside and make sure that the return label is tapped and visible on the outside of the package.
   \*\*DO NOT apply tape, return labels or any adhesive directly on the manufacturer’s packaging (shoes boxes, bindings boxes, etc). Pack the box(es) inside another box or bag and apply tape or adhesive to the outside of the parcel. Applying tape, adhesive or damaging in any way the manufacturer’s original packaging can result in reconditioning fees or the denial of your return.

5. Bring your package to your nearest post office: [https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/information/app/fpo/personal/findpostoffice](https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/information/app/fpo/personal/findpostoffice)

6. Your return will be processed within 14 business days following the receipt of your package at our warehouse. Original shipping costs are never refundable.

## Return shipping fees

Since we deal with 3rd party carriers, we are directly impacted by their charges and the recent increases in their pricing, which is why return shipping fees are to be paid entirely by the customer. The fee can vary depending on the size of your package and the location it’s shipped from. The amount of the return shipping fee will be displayed in the return portal once you complete your request.

## Reception of defective / damaged / incorrect items

It is the customer’s responsibility to inspect the entire order upon reception. It is also the customer’s responsibility to contact customer service within 7 days of reception to report any problem with the parcel or items in an order. The customer must keep ALL packaging and be able to send us pictures to allow us to make the proper verifications. We will then be able to make arrangements for an exchange or a refund. In the case of incorrect, defective or damaged items, said items must be returned before we can proceed with an exchange or a refund. The items must not be used, washed or altered in any way. They must have their original packaging and tags.

## Final sale items

Items marked as final sale CANNOT be returned, exchanged or refunded. You cannot exchange an item marked as final sale, even for the same item in a different size. These will be identified in the product page, cart and at checkout.

## Exchanges

We do not offer exchanges at the moment. If you would like to exchange the product you are returning for another size/color, we invite you to place a new order for the replacement of your choice. By proceeding this way, the replacement product will be reserved for you and it will be shipped to you without delays.

## In-store return

With the presentation of your online store order receipt, you have 30 days from the date your order was shipped to exchange or return for a refund at any of our retail stores. (Shipping fees are not refundable).
**No in-store return, credit or exchanges possible from December 26th to 29th.**

## Holiday return policy

Products purchased between November 1st and December 24th can be returned until January 31st online or in store. For online returns, your return claim must be placed before January 31st.

## Return to sender

If a parcel is shipped to an incorrect address, unclaimed or the delivery refused and then sent back to our warehouse, the shipping fees will not be refunded and a flat 15$ CAD fee will be charged. It is the customer's responsibility to provide a correct shipping address. It is also the customer’s responsibility to claim their package at a drop-off location within the delay prescribed by said drop-off location.
