## Processing and shipping delays

All orders are shipped on business days only (Monday to Friday). Expect your package to be shipped out in the 2-4 business days\* following the day you place an order. Should the delay be longer, we will contact you to let you know. This process cannot be expedited and all orders are processed in the order in which they are placed to be fair with all our customers.
